## 📖 About The Project  
This project is designed as a complete end-to-end **machine learning + web deployment** application.  
It showcases how a trained CNN model can be integrated into a clean, user-friendly web interface to make real-time predictions.

### 🎯 **Project Objectives**
- Build a deep learning model capable of detecting brain tumors from MRI images.
- Provide an interactive and simple UI for non-technical users.
- Deploy the app online so anyone can access it instantly.
- Demonstrate a complete ML lifecycle: training → testing → deployment.

## 📝 **Project Overview**

When a user uploads an MRI image (JPG/PNG), the app:

1. Preprocesses the image (resize, normalize).  
2. Feeds it into a trained CNN model (`.h5` file).  
3. Predicts **Tumor** / **No Tumor**.  
4. Displays:
   - The predicted class  
   - Confidence score  
   - Raw probabilities  
   - The MRI image preview  

The entire pipeline runs instantly inside the Streamlit interface.
